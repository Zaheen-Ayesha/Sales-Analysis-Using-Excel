# Sales-Analysis-Using-Excel

The primary objective of this sales analysis project is to analyze and evaluate the sales performance of a retail store and address the following key business questions posed by the client:
- Which products generate the highest revenue and profit, and what are their associated costs ?
- What are the trends in financial metrics such as revenue, cost, and profit over time ?
- How do order statuses(Completed, Returned) evolve, and what patterns can we identify?

The analysis aims to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help in making data-driven decisions to improve sales, optimize inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction.
